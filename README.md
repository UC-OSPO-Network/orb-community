# Open Repository Browser (ORB) community docs

This repo contains policies and guidelines that pertain to the UC OSPO Network's
ORB project. The ORB project consists of multiple sub-projects with their own
repos, so we created a single repo for shared project documents.

## Directory of ORB project repos

- [repofinder](https://github.com/UC-OSPO-Network/repofinder): A tool to
  identify and analyze open-source repositories affiliated with universities
  using GitHub metadata and contributor analysis.
- [repoexplorer](https://github.com/juanis2112/repoexplorer): An interactive
  Shiny dashboard for exploring university open source repositories,
  contributors, and activity.
- [orb-showcase](https://github.com/UC-OSPO-Network/orb-showcase): A web
  application for displaying data collected by the repofinder pipeline.
