## Ways to Contribute

We welcome ideas, feedback, questions, and suggestions.

For feedback or questions about ORB **code**, please create an issue in the
corresponding **code repository**.

For feedback or questions about **overall ORB governance, roadmap, or
strategy**, feel free to create an issue in **this repository**.

Since this project is moving very quickly, we recommend starting with an issue
rather than a PR. If you'd like to contribute some code and the maintainers
confirm that the feature is in scope, then here are some suggestions to improve
your PR (and its chances of being accepted):

- Include a clear description of what the PR does and why.
- Keep the PR focused on one "logical" update, not multiple unrelated updates.
- Link to relevant issues using "Fixes #123" or "Addresses #456".
- Use a formatter such as Prettier, even if you're just contributing text. (We
  will probably implement a formatting checker eventually.)
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
  where possible.
- Consider using "draft" and "ready" status labels
  ([click here for more information](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request)).

If you've never contributed to an upstream repository on GitHub, read
[this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
to learn the jargon and concepts.
[This tutorial](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/)
is also a good step-by-step walkthrough.

## Join our community

Anyone interested in this project or the OSPO is welcome to join
[our Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/uc-ospo-network/shared_invite/zt-3c6yw4l11-WU2PB4jUwAtXTDK09h8orQ)
and/or come to any of our
[coworking sessions](https://ucospo.net/events/#coworkingoffice-hours-ongoing).
These are casual, drop-in-if-you-feel-like it sessions where you can:

- Get help with a PR for this repo
- Ask questions relating to OSS in general, your campus OSPO, or the OSPO
  network
- Get help finding a project to work on, or getting more contributors for your
  own project
- Or just have a dedicated time to work on your projects or to tackle those
  important-but-often-postponed admin tasks

You never need an invite to join us. In fact, we want you to join us, even if
you don’t have anything you feel like you want to contribute. Just being there
is enough! You don’t have to turn on your video. The first time you come, just
introducing yourself is perfectly fine. Over time, we hope that you feel
comfortable voicing your opinions, giving feedback on others’ ideas, and even
sharing your own ideas, and experiences.

## Contact us

We generally try to keep our conversations on GitHub, but if you prefer to use
email, you can email ospo@ucsb.edu, or any of the folks listed here:
