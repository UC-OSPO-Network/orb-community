## Ways to Contribute

We welcome ideas, feedback, questions, and suggestions.

For comments about ORB **code, data, or UI**, please create an issue in the
corresponding **sub-project repository**.

For comments about **overall ORB governance, roadmap, or strategy**, feel free
to create an issue in **this repository**.

### Review the data

If you are a member of the [CURIOSS](https://curioss.org/) group, you can access
the ORB data for your university! Just create an issue in any of the ORB
repositories or email juanitagomezr2112@gmail.com, and we'll share it with you.
We would love your feedback on the accuracy of the pipeline's predictions.

### Review the UI

We hope to have the [repoexplorer](https://github.com/juanis2112/repoexplorer)
dashboard (a Shiny app) deployed on the web soon. In the meantime,
[CURIOSS](https://curioss.org/) members can download the data and deploy the app
locally if they wish. Please let us know what you think of the existing features
and what features you'd like to see next.

### Review the code

Since this project is moving very quickly, we recommend starting with an issue
rather than a PR. If the maintainers confirm that a PR is appropriate, then here
are some suggestions to improve your PR (and its chances of being accepted):

- Include a clear description of what the PR does and why.
- Keep the PR focused on one "logical" update, not multiple unrelated updates.
- Link to relevant issues using "Fixes #123" or "Addresses #456".
- Use a formatter such as Prettier, even if you're just contributing text. (We
  will probably implement a formatting checker eventually.)
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)
  where possible.
- Consider using "draft" and "ready" status labels
  ([click here for more information](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request)).

If you've never contributed to an upstream repository on GitHub, read
[this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
to learn the jargon and concepts.
[This tutorial](https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/)
is also a good step-by-step walkthrough.

## Join our community

Anyone interested in this project or the OSPO is welcome to join
[our Slack Workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/uc-ospo-network/shared_invite/zt-3c6yw4l11-WU2PB4jUwAtXTDK09h8orQ)
and/or come to any of our
[coworking sessions](https://ucospo.net/events/#coworkingoffice-hours-ongoing).
These are casual, drop-in-if-you-feel-like it sessions where you can:

- Get help with a PR for this repo
- Ask questions relating to OSS in general, your campus OSPO, or the OSPO
  network
- Get help finding a project to work on, or getting more contributors for your
  own project
- Or just have a dedicated time to work on your projects or to tackle those
  important-but-often-postponed admin tasks

You never need an invite to join us. In fact, we want you to join us, even if
you don’t have anything you feel like you want to contribute. Just being there
is enough! You don’t have to turn on your video. The first time you come, just
introducing yourself is perfectly fine. Over time, we hope that you feel
comfortable voicing your opinions, giving feedback on others’ ideas, and even
sharing your own ideas, and experiences.

## Contact us

We generally try to keep our conversations on GitHub, but if you prefer to use
email, you can email ospo@ucsb.edu, juanitagomezr2112@gmail.com, or any of the
folks listed here:
